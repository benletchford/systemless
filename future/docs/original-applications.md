# Original application reconnaissance

These are bounded startup checks, not application acceptance. No window or game
interaction has been exercised. The binaries are external fixtures and are not
redistributed in this repository.

Source archives were read from the local `systemless-games` corpus. Extract with
`unar -k visible`, then unwrap entry type 2 from the emitted AppleDouble `.rsrc`
file to obtain the raw resource fork. The entry table begins at byte 26, has the
big-endian count at byte 24, and contains 12-byte type/offset/length records.
Do not pass the AppleDouble container directly to `--code` or `--resources`.

| Application input | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Super Mines Demo raw resource fork (`super-mines.sit`) | 518906 | `0a04894b487ed9e42fd6e67f2b8fe17c050a40b0a4f52ee5a768a1ce524b1ec0` |
| Centaurian FAT data fork (`Centaurian_1.2.1.sit`) | 200976 | `ab5e510dce4ea5ecb1fb80a814d658d9f31f7551fd932018299b9df0def3cd65` |
| Centaurian FAT raw resource fork | 1769685 | `e2864ba05272a3d52a8f9f48ef45b8468403f315c4718518c12f5d52f6106d3f` |

Run `cargo run --manifest-path future/Cargo.toml -- --code RAW_RESOURCE_FORK
--budget 100000` for 68K, or `--pef DATA_FORK --resources RAW_RESOURCE_FORK
--budget 100000` for PPC. The `trace_application` example accepts `code`, the raw
fork path and a maximum instruction count, and prints register/opcode context.

## Observations

- Super Mines initially wrote through zero after reading CurStackBase ($0908),
  eventually faulting at $1000. Its CODE 0 declares 6678 bytes below A5. Publishing
  the start of those globals ($003FE5EA) fixes this specific loader defect. The
  original startup now initializes through $00400000, then passes ReleaseResource and stops at unsupported
  trap $A8FE at PC $0100D004 (trace index 13511).
- Centaurian's 68K path passes ReleaseResource, then faults writing $010000FC
  inside a loaded CODE segment at PC $01000270 (trace index 92039). The next
  investigation is startup relocation and segment write permissions.
- Centaurian's PPC load rejects the unresolved strong InterfaceLib import
  `SetSoundVol`. No PPC application instruction executes.

The loader now also publishes CurrentA5 ($0904) and the word CurJTOffset ($0934).
CurStackBase denotes the start of application globals; the current separate,
fixed stack reservation remains an explicit runtime limitation. A generated
instruction regression independently reads these globals and writes through
CurStackBase. This proves the launch contract, not original-app compatibility.

Semantics are documented in Apple's [Memory Manager summary](https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/pdf/Memory/Memory_Manager.pdf)
(page 2-104) and [Inside Macintosh volumes I–III](https://puyoman.net/documentation/Inside_Macintosh.pdf)
(global variables, III-227). ReleaseResource now invalidates loaded resource identity and permits reloads;
its error behavior and changed-resource retention follow Apple’s
[ReleaseResource contract](https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/MoreToolbox/MoreToolbox-85.html).
Next: investigate the Centaurian startup write and Super Mines’ next Toolbox trap. Full acceptance
still requires original application interactions on both architectures.
