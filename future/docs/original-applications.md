# Original application reconnaissance

These are bounded startup checks, not application acceptance. No window or game
interaction has been exercised. The binaries are external fixtures and are not
redistributed in this repository.

Source archives were read from the local `systemless-games` corpus. Extract with
`unar -k visible`, then unwrap entry type 2 from the emitted AppleDouble `.rsrc`
file to obtain the raw resource fork. The entry table begins at byte 26, has the
big-endian count at byte 24, and contains 12-byte type/offset/length records.
Do not pass the AppleDouble container directly to `--code` or `--resources`.

| Application input | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Super Mines Demo raw resource fork (`super-mines.sit`) | 518906 | `0a04894b487ed9e42fd6e67f2b8fe17c050a40b0a4f52ee5a768a1ce524b1ec0` |
| Centaurian FAT data fork (`Centaurian_1.2.1.sit`) | 200976 | `ab5e510dce4ea5ecb1fb80a814d658d9f31f7551fd932018299b9df0def3cd65` |
| Centaurian FAT raw resource fork | 1769685 | `e2864ba05272a3d52a8f9f48ef45b8468403f315c4718518c12f5d52f6106d3f` |

Run `cargo run --manifest-path future/Cargo.toml -- --code RAW_RESOURCE_FORK
--budget 100000` for 68K, or `--pef DATA_FORK --resources RAW_RESOURCE_FORK
--budget 100000` for PPC. The `trace_application` example accepts `code`, the raw
fork path and a maximum instruction count, and prints register/opcode context.

## Observations

- Super Mines initially wrote through zero after reading CurStackBase ($0908),
  eventually faulting at $1000. Its CODE 0 declares 6678 bytes below A5. Publishing
  the start of those globals ($003FE5EA) fixes this specific loader defect. The
  original startup now initializes through $00400000, then passes ReleaseResource,
  InitFonts, InitWindows, FlushEvents and InitMenus with graphics enabled. It proceeds
  through InitCursor, TEInit, InitDialogs, SysEnvirons and EventAvail, then enters
  event/mouse polling through GetMouse and PtInRect after
  PBGetCatInfo reports a missing directory, PBDirCreate creates it and
  PBHGetFInfo completes a file lookup and GetNewWindow creates its first
  hidden dBoxProc resource window and DetachResource transfers loaded
  resource ownership, NewControl creates its button-family controls,
  SizeWindow resizes the hidden window, SetWRefCon stores application data,
  MoveWindow positions it, ShowWindow reveals it and InvalRect requests redraw.
  A 100,000-instruction trace completes without an unsupported service.
  A bounded press/release at global (256,171) passes FindWindow, FindControl
  and StillDown, hides/disposes the demonstration splash, restores its saved
  nil port, creates/updates/reads its settings file, loads/installs its menu bar
  draws its menu titles, updates live items, constructs WIND 1000/two controls
  records/draws its polygon indicator and reaches the chooser event loop.
  A recorded-button press then reaches TrackControl ($A968).
  SystemTask preserves the empty periodic service state, PenSize updates live
  GrafPort dimensions and RectInRgn checks content intersections.
  GetPicture loads PICT 202, PortSize sizes its offscreen GrafPort and MovePortTo
  sets the bitmap mapping before drawing. DrawPicture now decodes that v1
  PackBitsRect/srcOr resource and executes through wgpu. CopyBits transfers
  the offscreen images. LineTo now draws through the shared GPU pen path
  and EraseRect clears its requested area before startup reaches a later
  picture containing default-highlight metadata and an 8-bit indexed PixMap.
  PICT 184 now completes table decoding, packed rows, mask and GPU monochrome
  conversion before the application requests a text box.
- Centaurian's 68K path originally faulted writing $010000FC at PC $01000270
  (trace index 92039). The target is a JSR operand containing $00000028; startup
  adds A5 to relocate it to $00400028. Classic CODE now permits writes and these
  relocations complete. Startup now also installs Toolbox replacements for
  LoadSeg ($A9F0), UnloadSeg ($A9F1), and ExitToShell ($A9F4). The next stop is
  unsupported GetGDevice ($AA32) at PC $10007426 (trace index 104863), after
  InitFonts/InitWindows/InitMenus/TEInit/InitCursor/InitDialogs/MaxApplZone
  (graphics enabled), HLock,
  StripAddress and executing resource-loaded code from heap RAM. The prior $A204
  request was Sound Driver Control(-4, 2), setting volume to 3. That state update
  now completes. No window interaction or audio playback is proven.
- Centaurian's PPC load rejects the unresolved strong InterfaceLib import
  `SndDisposeChannel`. TEStyleNew/TENew and TextEdit lifetime, TextFont/TextFace/TextMode/TextSize, NewWindow (plainDBox), InitWindows, GetPattern, ForeColor/BackColor, FrameRoundRect, Random, GetMemFragment and the symbol-query imports now resolve, but no PPC
  application instruction executes because remaining strong imports are still
  validated before launch.

The loader now also publishes CurrentA5 ($0904) and the word CurJTOffset ($0934).
CurStackBase denotes the start of application globals; the current separate,
fixed stack reservation remains an explicit runtime limitation. A generated
instruction regression independently reads these globals and writes through
CurStackBase. This proves the launch contract, not original-app compatibility.

Semantics are documented in Apple's [Memory Manager summary](https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/pdf/Memory/Memory_Manager.pdf)
(page 2-104) and [Inside Macintosh volumes I–III](https://puyoman.net/documentation/Inside_Macintosh.pdf)
(global variables, III-227). ReleaseResource now invalidates loaded resource identity and permits reloads;
its error behavior and changed-resource retention follow Apple’s
[ReleaseResource contract](https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/MoreToolbox/MoreToolbox-85.html).
InitFonts ($A8FE) now loads a guest system font or allocates the licensed fallback.
InitMenus ($A930) owns and draws an empty bar through shared guest state/wgpu.
InitCursor ($A850) now initializes shared cursor state for the GPU presentation
overlay. InitDialogs ($A97B) now initializes shared dialog globals and parameter
StringHandles. SysEnvirons now reports the shared compatibility profile; common
loading maps/publishes the full fixed heap and MaxApplZone preserves its extent.
Fresh traces pass EventAvail/SetRect, bold TETextBox, GetMouse and PtInRect in Super Mines; a press/release dismisses the splash and reaches PBHOpen. Centaurian reaches GetGDevice. Actual
onscreen cursor behavior, heap-zone resizing, menu/dialog construction, window
custom definitions and original application interaction remain unfinished.
Dynamic memory loading is verified with the MPW resource-plugin fixture;
Centaurian has not yet executed its own GetMemFragment calls. Full acceptance
still requires original application interactions on both architectures.

Super Mines TextBox calls now complete with the selected family-3, size-9 bold
strike. Layout and clipping use the shared TextEdit/GPU route, with a synthesized
one-pixel bold source. A bounded press/release now dismisses that original splash;
gameplay and complete lifecycle acceptance remain pending. Native styled-text
pixel comparison has not passed. Legacy Systemless
comparison alone is permitted by the user; native System 7 execution is optional.

A reproducible bounded click probe captures PPM images before and after dispatch:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path future/Cargo.toml --example probe_mouse -- CODE_RESOURCE_FORK /tmp/mines-probe 256 171
```

This diagnostic loads a 68K CODE fork, runs 30,000 startup boundaries, injects
mouse-down, then permits up to 30,000 more boundaries before mouse-up and another
30,000. It propagates service faults; screenshots are evidence, not automatic
acceptance. No original application/resource bytes are added to the repository.

The current probe at (256,171) dismisses the splash, then opens
`Super Mines Demo Settings` with read/write permission in its created preferences
directory. The missing-file path creates both forks, sets Finder metadata, reopens
the data fork and executes EOF/seek/write/read operations. It then queries GetMHandle(4), closes the file and probes Gestalt selectors
ppc-space and evnt, both correctly unavailable. It loads and installs MBAR 1000,
counts menu 1's items, calls AddResMenu('DRVR') and draws the original menu bar.
It changes menu 4's mark, text and command key, reads settings, constructs WIND
1000/two controls, creates menu 5010 and appends four game names. It shows the
window and draws the game/difficulty chooser, including its polygon indicator.
The splash press/release finishes its bounded execution without a service fault.
A second click at (145,150) also completes; this is input delivery and drawing,
not accepted chooser selection. The estimated point (330,230) misses the actual
control rectangle. A press at global (402,231), chosen from live bounds/status,
reaches TrackControl ($A968), post-trap PC $0100EC06, before mouse release.
Confirmation, popup interaction, gameplay and a complete lifecycle remain unverified.
Files remain process-local. Next: actual held-mouse control tracking/callbacks and
resume this chooser interaction, preserving the real CPU reply and input lifecycle.

An earlier record mislabeled decimal 43313 as $A9B1/CreateResFile. It is actually
$A931/NewMenu; resource-file creation is accepted separately through generated and
MPW-compiled guests. Original-app bytes remain outside the repository.
The full rebuild goal remains active.

The diagnostic also accepts additional coordinate pairs. To reproduce the current
tracking boundary, append `145 150 402 231` after the initial `256 171` click.
Every press/release has a separate 30,000-boundary budget. A failed press is not
followed by a release or later click. Multiple-click runs save per-step screens;
error output includes the hexadecimal trap and native stack bytes for continuation.


## 2026-10-15: cooperative standard-control tracking

TrackControl now suspends either real CPU with its ABI reply pending while the
host button is held. Shared control state redraws push buttons, checkboxes and
radio buttons on drag out/reentry and returns the released part or zero outside.
Coordinates use the control owner even when the caller port is nil; checkbox and
radio values remain caller-owned. A queued release uses its saved position and
removes only that event; unrelated and later events retain order. Physical release
also works when mouse-up events are masked. No guest instructions spin while held.
Nil action procedures and the stored-action sentinel resolving to nil are accepted;
nonzero action/custom definition callbacks remain explicit errors. Draw failures
restore hilite and preserve MemErr. DisposeMenu releases caller-owned menu handles
without implicitly deleting menu-list entries or replacing resource ownership rules.

Generated tests cover both ABI frames, delayed result guards, held/drag/release
pixels, disabled/missed controls, cancellation, event ordering, nil caller ports,
callback rejection and drawing rollback. An MPW-compiled fixture on both CPUs
waits for host input, drags out and back, releases, then exits successfully.

The original Super Mines sequence (256,171), (145,150), (402,231) now waits on the
third press and completes its release. It hides/disposes the chooser, disposes its
created menu and opens WIND 1001 titled Super Mines. The partial game window then
stops at Pack7 ($A9EE), post-trap PC $0101264E. Selector word zero at SP $0080FA02,
D0=5 and A0=$0080FA2E identify NumToString. Gameplay, popup interaction and complete
lifecycle acceptance remain unverified. Next: shared signed integer decimal
conversion with the Pack7/PPC ABI boundaries, then continue real game drawing.
Native presentation, original PPC compatibility, production Mixed Mode and the
other documented gaps remain required. The full rebuild goal stays active.


## 2026-10-15: shared integer decimal conversion

NumToString/StringToNum now use one memory-only decimal service. Native Pack7
$A9EE selectors zero/one pop only their selector word, use D0/A0 and preserve the
void formatting result; parsing returns D0. PPC imports receive r3/r4, write the
Pascal string or big-endian long output, and preserve void return registers.
Unsupported SANE selectors remain explicit errors before selector-stack mutation.
Signed formatting handles the complete i32 range and writes only the Pascal
length/content. Parsing snapshots input before overlapping output and wraps
multiply/add/negation at 32 bits. Neither operation allocates guest memory or
changes MemErr/ResErr.

The Roman parser consumes every character after an optional initial sign using
its low four bits; spaces contribute zero, CAT yields 314 and 2: yields 30. This
follows Apple's [Text Utilities reference](https://leopard-adc.pepas.com/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Text_Utilities/DeprecationAppendix/AppendixADeprecatedAPI.html#//apple_ref/c/func/StringToNum).
Legacy Systemless instead skips whitespace and stops at nondigits; that reference
behavior is not copied where it contradicts the documented contract. Script
Manager patching/international conversion and SANE decimal scanners remain gaps.

Four new default tests cover signed limits, byte guards, atomic output faults,
truncated/maximal Pascal input, overlapping storage, unusual digits/wrapping,
unsupported/short selector frames and both real CPU routes/register preservation.
Rebuilt MPW environment guests call both functions five times on each CPU and
verify signed minimum, zero, CAT and negative overflow before successful exit.

The same original Super Mines click sequence (256,171), (145,150), (402,231)
passes two NumToString calls for 5 and 0, rendering those numbers in the partially
drawn game window. It next stops at CopyMask ($A817), post-trap PC $0100B298,
after loading cicn 130. The stack at $0080F8EA begins with six pointers, from
last to first: dstRect=$0080F9DC, maskRect=$1001098C, srcRect=$1001099A,
dstBits=$1000224E, maskBits=$10010986, srcBits=$10010994. Next: shared GPU
masked bitmap copying with checked snapshots, scaling and ABI coverage, then
continue the original icon/board drawing. Popup interaction, gameplay and full
application lifecycle acceptance remain unverified. The full rebuild stays active.


## 2026-10-15: GPU one-bit masked bitmap copying

CopyMask now marshals six checked pointers from the native 24-byte Pascal frame
or PPC registers into one shared Ports service. Source, mask and destination are
basic monochrome BitMaps with independent signed origins/strides. Equal-sized
source/mask rectangles can scale to a different destination rectangle. Both input
bitmaps are unpacked into immutable snapshots before destination publication,
including aliased storage. The existing GPU blit accepts a borrowed one-bit mask;
its bounded mask payload is serialized after clip/palette parameters. Pixel
coverage and source selection run in WGSL, not a CPU framebuffer loop. Packing
retains destination padding bits and row padding.

CopyBits and CopyMask share live port colors, destination-alias stride checks,
origin translation and visible/clip region coverage; offscreen targets use their
own bounds. Masked scaling samples the source/mask pair with the legacy
Systemless nearest-neighbor rule. Ordinary Basic CopyBits keeps its tested OR
reduction. This reference comparison is not native System 7 pixel acceptance.
One-bit copying follows Apple's [CopyMask contract](https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-167.html).
Indexed/direct source/destination PixMaps, deep/color masks, printing and active
recording/custom-procedure contexts remain unsupported and fail explicitly.
Bitmap/GPU extents remain bounded to 4096 per axis; clip work stays bounded.
Malformed extents, rectangle-size mismatch, unsupported flags, excessive normalized
coordinates and protected destinations fail before pixels are published.


One default ABI test and three GPU tests exercise both real CPUs, exact argument
order/void results, short frames, pixel masks, enlargement/reduction, differing
origins, complex clip holes, source/mask/destination overlap, foreign targets,
live colors, row padding, MemErr and rejected malformed/protected storage.
Existing CopyBits pixel tests pass after sharing their target/clip setup. Rebuilt
MPW drawing guests execute a masked copy and inspect all four result rows and
padding bytes on both CPUs before their existing lifecycle success.

The 30,000-boundary Super Mines sequence (256,171), (145,150), (402,231) completes
its third release without a service fault, including one real CopyMask call.
The captured frame has numeric labels and a status icon but a blank board. A
longer 300,000-boundary-per-step run reaches a different fault: GetResource('CURS',4)
returns nil, followed by SetCursor(nil), post-trap PC $010026B8, SP $0080FB0C.
This is the missing standard watch cursor resource, not a CopyMask fault or
accepted gameplay. Next: shared standard cursor-resource fallback ownership and
application-resource precedence, then continue original new-game initialization.
SetCursor(nil) must not be hidden behind a silent success. The original PPC app,
production Mixed Mode, native presentation and other documented gaps remain.
The full rebuild goal stays active.

The mouse diagnostic now accepts SYSTEMLESS_PROBE_BUDGET (1..=10000000) to choose
an explicit per-step boundary budget; the default remains 30000. It reports that
budget, preserves separate press/release slices and still propagates faults.


## 2026-10-15: standard cursor resource fallback provider

The shared Resource Manager now searches a ROM-free fallback provider for unnamed
CURS IDs 1..4 after the application map. Those IDs represent I-beam, crosshair,
plus and watch cursors, following Apple's [Cursor Utilities contract](https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-371.html).
Their static 68-byte records use the legacy Systemless reference artwork and
hotspots; they are not claimed as native System-file pixel parity. No System file,
ROM, legacy runtime dependency or original-app bytes are bundled.

GetCursor and GetResource('CURS',id) already marshal to the same resource service
on both CPUs; they now obtain one cached, heap-owned handle. Release/dispose clear
its identity, detach retains caller-owned storage and a later lookup reloads the
fallback bytes independently. SetCursor still copies its image, so releasing the
resource does not invalidate presentation. Heap exhaustion returns nil/ResErr
without publishing a cache entry. Application cursor records take precedence,
including short or compressed records; unsupported application compression fails
rather than silently selecting a fallback. Standard fallbacks do not modify the
application resource map or current resource file reference.

The fallback CURS type participates in absent-ID and full-chain absent-name
ResErr reporting. Fallback cursors are unnamed; Get1NamedResource continues to
search only the application map. This provider does not establish support for
multiple open resource maps, general system resources, enumeration of a virtual
System resource file or writable resource maps.


Three new default tests verify all four cursor layouts/hotspots, cached identity,
release/detach/reload behavior, full heap reclamation/exhaustion recovery,
application precedence, unsupported compression, missing-ID/type/name results,
both real CPU adapters and copied cursor state after release. Existing resource
lifetime and cursor rendering tests pass. Rebuilt MPW tracking guests obtain the
watch through GetCursor and GetResource, check its 68-byte handle, set/release it
and reload it before their existing held-button interaction on both CPUs.

The original Super Mines 300000-boundary-per-step sequence (256,171), (145,150),
(402,231) now passes GetResource('CURS',4) and SetCursor with a valid pointer.
It continues new-game initialization, invalidates the board and loads TILE 1101,
then stops at GetResInfo ($A9A8), post-trap PC $01005840. Native SP $0080FAA2 holds
name=$0080FB1E, type=$0080FACA, ID=$0080FACE, resource handle=$10002544. Next:
shared resource metadata/ownership queries and both ABI boundaries, then continue
original tile loading. The board is still blank; gameplay and complete lifecycle
acceptance remain unverified. Original PPC compatibility, production Mixed Mode,
native presentation and the other recorded gaps remain required. The full rebuild
goal stays active.
