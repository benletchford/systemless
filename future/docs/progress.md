# Progress and continuation

## Isolation and evidence

- Baseline: `634c0e9120a695224d71c621fbbe33709670d707`.
- Original checkout: `/Users/ben/.codex/worktrees/b2f1/systemless`, preserved.
- Rebuild: `/Users/ben/.codex/worktrees/future/systemless`, `dev/future`.
- Public tracking issue: https://github.com/benletchford/systemless/issues/4801.
- No existing runtime/website files changed. `future` is its own Cargo workspace
  with a pinned lockfile and no dependency on the old `systemless` package.

## 2026-10-13: executable foundation

Implemented:

- Checked u32 guest pointers; mapping overlap, permissions, endian access,
  bounded scalar writes and explicit instruction alignment/fetch permissions.
- Real m68k 68020 and PPC engines borrowing one memory object, distinct private
  fixture ABI adapters, a single typed service dispatcher and observable state.
- Deterministic bounded stepping, terminal faults/exits, unknown-call errors.
- WGSL integer indexed fill/pattern/clip/Copy/Or/Xor/Bic and source-snapshot
  overlap copies; GPU palette expansion; padded RGBA readback. Guest bytes are
  synchronized before execution resumes. No legacy renderer or CPU fallback.
- winit host window, nearest/aspect-preserving scaling, resize, zero-size skip,
  lost/outdated surface handling, explicit GPU error reporting, bounded smoke.
- Internal callback descriptors and continuation stack holding whole caller
  engines; nested 68K -> PPC -> 68K and PPC caller preservation tests.

Acceptance status:

1. Foundation: CPU and offscreen GPU executable and tested on native
   macOS/Metal. Windowed implementation compiles; actual presentation remains
   unverified because the Mac was locked. Browser integration, device recovery
   and non-Metal hosts remain unverified.
2. Both architectures: synthetic machine-code fixtures pass distinct ABI paths;
   an additional test switches CPUs within one live runtime and checks that the
   second call sees the first call's accumulator state.
3. First graphics slice: synthetic dual-CPU direct-write/XOR parity passes
   exact expected indices and RGBA comparison. These are graphics primitive
   contracts, not a claim of complete QuickDraw/Toolbox ABI compatibility.
4. Application lifecycle: not implemented. No original application was run.
5. Mixed-mode: internal transition mechanism tested, but Apple descriptors,
   ProcInfo, real Mixed Mode ABI and Toolbox callback continuations are pending.
6. Compatibility expansion: pending ordinary-application loading.

Verification on Apple M1, Metal adapter (2026-10-13):

- `cargo test --manifest-path future/Cargo.toml --locked --offline -- --include-ignored`:
  11 integration tests including 2 real-GPU tests; all passed.
- Default suite: 9 non-GPU tests, 2 intentionally ignored GPU tests.
- Window smoke: **unavailable**, not passed. The initial smoke counted skipped
  frames; this was corrected before commit. The strict smoke receives Metal
  `Occluded` for every acquisition and exits with an error after 600 paced
  attempts. Computer-use inspection confirmed the Mac is locked. Rerun
  `cargo run --manifest-path future/Cargo.toml --locked --offline -- --window --smoke`
  and the same command with `--ppc` once unlocked. Actual presentation, resize
  and zero-size acceptance are pending; the code must never count an occluded
  frame as a successful presentation.
- Strict all-target clippy; changed-file rustfmt only. No legacy build/format
  gate was run: the replacement has no legacy source dependencies.
- No screenshot/native Macintosh oracle comparisons yet. GPU expectations are
  independently specified synthetic values. Forced surface/device-loss paths
  and actual OS minimization were not exercised.

## Next executable milestone

First rerun strict window acceptance once the Mac is unlocked; do not mark
foundation complete until it passes. Continue independent loader work meanwhile.

Keep working in this worktree/branch. Read architecture.md and run the above
contracts before broad changes. Do not port either old runtime wholesale.

1. Resource/CODE/PEF loading and a shared resource/handle slice are implemented
   below. Extend through executable application behavior, not isolated stubs.
2. PEF application lifecycle is implemented below; extend toward real compiler
   startup and shared-library closure support through application-driven slices.
3. Add shared VFS forks and a deterministic event queue, preserving host-policy
   separation from ABI handlers.
4. Build one minimal reproducible ordinary Toolbox application in both ISAs
   that allocates memory, reads a resource, draws, consumes an event, and exits.
   Add actual 68K stack/register and PPC CFM adapters for precisely those calls.
   Retain private fixtures as architecture tests, clearly labelled.
5. Verify shared semantics and pixels; then select Toolbox Showcase Graphics
   and Controls interactions. Keep native-authoritative and legacy evidence
   separate. Do not call an app compatible from launch or first-frame output.
6. Parse real RoutineDescriptor/ProcInfo and implement declared signatures,
   return storage, TOC and reentrant service continuations. The current internal
   descriptor tests establish control flow only, not Mixed Mode compatibility.

Known technical debt: full-image upload and synchronous readback on each draw,
new GPU buffers per operation, native blocking scheduler, only 8-bit indexed
surfaces and rectangular clips, no QuickDraw port state, packed pixels, text,
region masks, archive intake, persistence, audio or guest UI. The fixture CLI
is deliberately small. CPU faults terminate rather than deliver restartable
Macintosh exceptions. Callback stack slots are private runtime reservations;
a real allocator must reserve them before application address-space loading.

## 2026-10-14: resource/CODE/PEF and shared process slice

Implemented checked resource maps, near CODE/A5 jump tables, PEF sections, all
pattern-data operations and documented relocation opcode families, bounded
import resolution and main transition vectors. Both architectures now invoke
actual Macintosh ABI adapters for resource lookup, handles, timing and exit.
A single process owns the heap/resource cache; a test switches CPU architecture
inside one loaded Runtime and verifies preserved handle identity and mutated data.

Verification on Apple M1/Metal:

- Full explicit-GPU suite: 29 tests passed (6 unit, 11 contracts, 12 loading).
- Strict local all-target clippy passed. The foundation CI used a newer compiler
  and found constant `chunks_exact` calls; these are replaced with `as_chunks`.
  Both replacement-runtime CI runs passed for commit `86b2ae02`.
- Generated CODE application: Exit(0), 23 instructions, 5 service calls.
- Generated PEF application with resource fork: Exit(0), 46 instructions,
  5 service calls. Reproduction commands are in the README.
- Malformed/truncated inputs, relocation addends/repeats/budgets, weak/strong
  imports, allocation reuse/exhaustion, cleared memory, resource identity and
  low-memory error/tick visibility have focused tests.

No original application has been run. Window acceptance remains pending as
recorded above. Far-model CODE, compressed resources, full CFM lifecycle, files,
events, QuickDraw ABI, real Mixed Mode descriptors and complete application
interactions remain unfinished. **The rebuild goal remains active and incomplete.**

## 2026-10-14: bounded PEF application lifecycle

Added initializer/main/terminator sequencing, relocated entry/TOC validation and
a guest initialization block describing the memory container. Tests cover
phase ordering across budgets, initialization failure, preserved main results,
ExitToShell cleanup with/without initialization, one-time cleanup, fault paths
and nonreturning routines. All 34 tests, including 2 explicit GPU tests, and
strict all-target clippy pass locally on Apple M1/Metal.

This extends the single application fragment loader. Dynamic shared libraries,
closure dependency ordering and guest CFM connection APIs remain unfinished.
Original application interactions, events/files/QuickDraw ABI and window
acceptance are still the next major executable gaps; the full goal stays active.

## Compiler-generated continuation probe

Both lifecycle CI runs passed for `9d293bac`. The existing local MPW Docker image
also compiled `future/fixtures/mpw/probe.c` for both architectures, with standard
startup libraries and generated DATA resources. Its reproducible build and exact
run commands are documented beside the source. `trace_application` provides a
bounded instruction/register/service trace without changing guest execution.

The compiled probe does not run yet: 68K startup consumes the initial stack word
as launch data and faults reading 0x8100 at PC 0x01000456; PPC preparation rejects
required `StdCLib:_BreakPoint`. These are the next concrete startup requirements
to investigate, before events and QuickDraw. Do not bypass startup or resolve
imports with silent stubs to make the probe appear compatible. Generated binaries
remain ignored; the original checkout is still clean and unchanged.

## 2026-10-14: compiler-observed CODE startup return contract

The MPW trace established that startup reads and compares the caller's code
bytes; it was not consuming a Finder parameter structure. CODE launch now maps a
readable, immutable, executable ExitToShell trampoline and puts that address on
the initial stack. A guest fixture reads its instruction bytes and returns
through it, verifying actual service dispatch rather than private-sentinel exit.

The compiled 68K probe advances through global initialization to GetOSTrapAddress
(A346) at boundary 759, querying Gestalt (A1AD). Trap address lookup needs coherent
Unimplemented identity and callable supported entries; a constant success or
arbitrary dummy address would violate the documented contract. Primary evidence:
https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/OSUtilities/OSUtilities-175.html and
https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/OSUtilities/OSUtilities-177.html.

The compiled PPC import inventory is recorded in the probe README, including
StdCLib data symbols. The next executable milestone is still both ordinary
compiler-generated probes reaching and completing their resource/handle checks,
then extending them through events and QuickDraw. The rebuild remains incomplete.

Validation for the return-trampoline fix: all 35 tests pass, including both
explicit GPU tests, and strict all-target clippy passes on Apple M1/Metal.

## 2026-10-14: callable trap lookup and current resource map

Implemented GetOSTrapAddress/GetToolboxTrapAddress/NGetTrapAddress, shared
Unimplemented identity with explicit dsCoreErr failure, and callable 68K OS and
Toolbox entries. Tests cover number masks, PPC/68K identity, preservation of
unrelated error state, D1 modifier words, Pascal arguments/results and shared heap
operations through retrieved addresses. CurResFile now reflects the process's
installed application resource map through both ABIs.

All 41 tests pass (including both real-GPU tests), as does strict all-target clippy.
The compiled 68K MPW probe now reaches boundary 902: HFSDispatch A260 selector 8,
PBGetFCBInfo, with its application's resource-file reference. The next slice needs
an actual virtual file/fork record supplying this information, then the following
startup requests. Do not supply arbitrary successful file metadata. Relevant
primary layouts: https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/Files/Files-122.html and
https://dev.os9.ca/techpubs/mac/Files/Files-301A.html. PPC StdCLib support and both
compiler-generated applications reaching their C main remain incomplete.

## 2026-10-14: virtual file metadata and compiled 68K acceptance

Application loading now retains original fork bytes in a process-owned read-only
virtual file. PBGetFCBInfo reports actual fork metadata through both CPU ABIs,
with indexed/direct-reference lookup, error results, big-endian parameter blocks,
68K condition codes and validation of all output ranges before mutation. Named
resource lookup uses exact names and the same handle cache as ID lookup.

The unmodified MPW-generated 68K probe now completes startup and its C main:
1308 boundaries, 18 service calls, Exit(0). Its C checks verify resource presence
and length, cleared allocation contents and disposal. The explicit MPW acceptance
test checks the ordered service trace and is ignored unless its generated binary
exists; see fixtures/mpw/README.md to build and run it. This is one controlled
compiler-generated app, not original-app or general Toolbox compatibility.

Validation: all 47 tests passed with explicit GPU and MPW tests on Apple M1/Metal;
strict all-target clippy passed. Default suites have 44 passing/3 ignored tests.
New tests cover both FCB ABIs, real fork bytes/lengths, reference and volume errors,
atomic output faults, missing resource forks, named-resource case/raw bytes,
truncated Pascal names, cached identity and both named-resource ABIs.

Next: implement the PPC probe's StdCLib functions/data contracts, preserving the
real startup path. Then extend both compiled apps through deterministic events
and actual QuickDraw drawing. Virtual file read/open/close and additional resource
maps, async callbacks, window acceptance and real Mixed Mode are still incomplete.
The full rebuild goal remains active.
